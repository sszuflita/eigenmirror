# eigenmirror

Software designed to perform face detection using Kirby and Sirovich's (1987) eigenface approach. The initial goal of this project is to build eigenface representations of camera input in real time.

TODO:
a) train based on face database
b) compute eigen representation of a face
c) benchmark b), determine feasibility of real time computation
d) experiment with larger face database / preprocessing of faces
e) experiment with display
