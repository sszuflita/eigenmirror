# eigenmirror

Software designed to perform face detection using Kirby and Sirovich's (1987) eigenface approach.

This program uses Haar feature-based cascade classification to identify faces in a dataset of images, and then computes eigenfaces for those images.

Built using opencv and light python scripting.
